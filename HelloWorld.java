/*
You may or may not have this program as part of a package.
Everything in Java is done in terms of Class Structures.
A Class is a collection of data and procedures (called methods).
The command "public" indicates that something is available to other classes and method.
"Public" would be in contrast with "Private."
"Static" indicates that there is only one of something no matter how many objects 
 of the same type are instantiated.
For examples one could instantiate "Hello World" multiple times, 
 but there would only be one "main" for them all.
"void" indicates that there is no output or input.  
   In this case the void indicates that there is no output to another class.
   Of course there is output to the console.
"String[] args" indicates that the inputs to the mainline should be 
   stored in an array of strings.  
In this case there would actually be no inputs to the mainline.
"System.out.println" indicates that the method println comes from the class "System"
  with subclass "out".
